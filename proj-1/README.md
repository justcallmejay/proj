### ABOUT PROJECT

This project is created for users to make their own fairly long term goal.  It allows users to begin with a simple idea of a long term goal that will last three months, then breaking them into smaller achievable goals in hopes that this builds a habit (or, at least, gives the user a sense of what it is like to chase after a goal.  Your lifestyle may have been adjusted).

Users should start thinking of a chllenging, yet achievable goal.  What would you like to achieve by the end of three months?  Do you believe you can accomplish this sooner?  

Next, each monthly goal will be broken down to weekly goals.  How can you break down a long term goal into sub-components?  

Additionally, this project will allow users to check a box that reports the progress of the goal.  Only the first checkbox will be avaiable to click.  Once that checkbox is clicked, IT IS LOCKED.  Therefore, make sure you truly did accompished it.  However, your goals are tracked at your own pace, but this project would like for you to achieve it within a week span.
